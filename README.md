# Linked-loop Code

Link to the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10289955

To start a simulation of this paper "coding for the unsourced a-channel with erasures: the linked loop code", please use go to the main branch and use the command "python ach_runner.py --ka=50 --pe=0.1" to start a single simulation with a number of active users = 50 and the parameter of the iid Bernoulli trials to be 0.1. 

Three coding methods (linked loop code, tree code and LDPC code) will be used and their results will be put together for comparison.
